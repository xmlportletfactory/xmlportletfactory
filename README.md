## Previous versions

For informations about version 3.0 (compatible with Liferay 6.0, 6.1 and 6.2), go to http://xmlportletfactory.org. 

## Features 

* Because XMLPortletFactory uses Liferay's Service Builder, tables are automaticly created for you at portlet deployment.
* Generated portlets use Liferay's search container, tags, etc. So they have very "Liferay" behavior, melting very well with themes.
* Languages English, French, Italian, Finnish and Spanish already implemented.
